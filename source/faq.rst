Network Coding
--------------

Questions about general terms and concepts in network coding.

What is a source, sink, and relay?
..................................
.. _source:
.. _relay:
.. _sink:

One common application for erasure correcting codes (which includes
network coding) is to improve the performance of computer networks or
communication networks in general. For such applications, specific
terminology is often used to precisely define the roles of the
different entities in the network. For example:

A source is a device that transmits data to one or more other
devices(s). This is also often called the server.

A sink is a device that receives data from other devices(s). These
are also sometimes referred to as the clients.

A relay is a device that receives data from other devices(s) and
re-transmits that data to other devices(s), typically the relay itself
is not interested in receiving the data.

What do we mean by the original data?
.....................................

The original data is a file or a buffer stored in memory before it is
passed to the erasure correcting code. We sometimes also refer
to this as the uncoded data.

What is a code?
...............
.. _code:

Coding can be thought of as transforming the original data
to a form that is more appropriate for transportation. The kind of codes
that is implemented in Kodo are erasure codes which can be used to
recover packet erasures. A packet erasure is the loss of a packet,
similar to if your letter is lost in the postal service.

What is a rateless code?
........................
.. _rateless:

With a rateless code an infinite number of representations of the
original data can be created, unlike for codes with a rate where a
fixed number of representations are possible. That make it possible to
recover from any number of erasures with a rateless code.

What is a finite field?
.......................
.. _finite_field:

A finite field or Galois Field (GF) is a mathematical construct and entails
to much explanations to be included here. It is not necessary to have
a deep understanding of finite fields, but some understanding is
useful. Simplified a finite field is a variable where special rules
are defined for the arithmetic operations. These rules guarantee that
the result of operating on a finite field will always result in a
value that is in the field which is very useful on computers with
fixed precision. One common field is the binary field GF(2) where
addition is defined by the XOR operation. Typically GF(2) or GF(2^8)
is used since they correspond to a bit and a byte respectively. The
size of a field is typically denoted :math:`q`.

What is an element?
...................
.. _finite_field_element:

An element is an element in a GF which can be thought of as a variable
with the type of a specific finite field variable.

What is a symbol?
.................
.. _symboÄº:

A symbol is a vector of GF elements that represent some data. The size
of a symbol is given by the number of elements and the size of each
element.

:math:`|\boldsymbol{s}| = n \cdot \log_2(q) ~ [b]`

As an example 16 elements in GF(2) can represent two bytes.

What is a generation?
.....................
.. _generation:

Each generation constitutes :math:`g` symbols of size :math:`m`, where
:math:`g` is called the generation size. The :math:`g` original
symbols in one generation, are arranged in the matrix
:math:`\boldsymbol{M}= [ \boldsymbol{m}_1 ; \boldsymbol{m}_2 ; \dots
; \boldsymbol{m}_g ]`, where :math:`\boldsymbol{m}_i` is a column
vector. In an application the block of data can be a file or a part of
a media stream, and is divided into :math:`\lceil \frac{B}{m} \rceil`
pieces, called symbols. Generation number 0 constitutes the first `g`
symbols, or the first :math:`g \cdot m` bytes of data, there are
:math:`\lceil \frac{B}{g \cdot m} \rceil` of such generations.

What is the generation size?
............................
.. _generation_size:

The generation size is the number of symbols in the generation denoted
:math:`g`.


What is a coding vector?
........................
.. _coding_vector:

The coding vector describes how a coded symbol was coded. It contains
a coefficient (which is a element) for each symbol in the generation.

The coding vector is typically denoted; :math:`\boldsymbol{v} = \{v_0;
v_1; ... ; v_{g-1} \}`

This column vector of elements are the coefficients which have been
multiplied onto the original symbols.


What is a coded symbol?
.......................
.. _coded_symbol:

A coded symbol is a symbol which is a combination of the original
symbols in a generation. Therefore a coded symbol is a representation
of all the data in a generation, but it has the same size as an
original symbol.

A coded symbol is encoded by multiplying the original data with a
coding vector; :math:`\boldsymbol{x} = \boldsymbol{M} \cdot
\boldsymbol{v}`. See encoding_ for a more detailed description, and
recoding_ for how coded symbols are created when recoding.

What is a coded packet?
.......................
.. _coded_packet:

Is a pair of a coded symbol and a coding vector. To decode a coded
symbol the corresponding coding vector must be known and therefore
typically the two are transmitted together in a single packet;
:math:`\{ \boldsymbol{v}, \boldsymbol{x} \}`


What is linear dependency?
..........................
.. _linear_dependency:

A packet is non-innovative or linearly dependent if it only contains
information about previously known symbols. In other words, the packet
can be reduced to the zero vector using the linear combination of some
(partially) decoded symbols.

What is systematic coding?
..........................
.. _systematic_coding:

Systematic coding means first transmitting all symbols in two
stages. In the first stage, the sender transmits all original symbols
uncoded.  In the second stage, the sender generates random linear
combinations of the original symbols in order to correct any packet
losses which might have occurred during the first stage.

What is the code density?
.........................
.. _code_density:

The code density can be defined as the ratio of non-zero elements in
an coding vector. Full density can be achieved by selecting coding
coefficients according to a random uniform distribution. In contrast,
sparse codes use many zero coefficients in the coding vectors which
makes the encoding process significantly faster. The density of a
coding vector is the ratio of non-zero elements in the coding vector.

:math:`d(\boldsymbol{v}) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^g \boldsymbol{v}_i \neq
0}{g}`, where: :math:`\boldsymbol{v}_i` is the coding vector

The density is sometimes also referred to as the degree.

How does encoding work?
.......................
.. _encoding:

To encode a new symbol :math:`\boldsymbol{x}` from a generation at the
source, :math:`\boldsymbol{M}` is multiplied with a randomly generated
coding vector :math:`\boldsymbol{v}` of length :math:`g`,
:math:`\boldsymbol{x} = \boldsymbol{M} \cdot \boldsymbol{v}`. In this
way we can construct :math:`g+r` coded symbols and coding vectors,
where :math:`r` is any number of redundant symbols as the code is
rateless. When a coded symbol is transmitted on the network it is
accompanied by its coding vector, and together they form a coded
packet. A practical interpretation is that each coded symbol, is a
combination or mix of the original symbols from one generation. The
benefit is that nearly infinite coded symbols can be created.

How does decoding work?
.......................
.. _decoding:

In order for a sink to successfully decode a generation, it must
receive :math:`g` linearly independent symbols and coding vectors from
that generation. All received symbols are placed in the matrix
:math:`\boldsymbol{\hat{X}} = [\boldsymbol{\hat{x}_1} ;
\boldsymbol{\hat{x}_2} ; \dots ; \boldsymbol{\hat{x}_g}]` and all
coding vectors are placed in the matrix
:math:`\boldsymbol{\hat{V}}=[\boldsymbol{\hat{v}_1} ;
\boldsymbol{\hat{v}_2} ; \dots ;\boldsymbol{\hat{v}_g} ]`, we denote
:math:`\boldsymbol{\hat{V}}` the coding matrix. The original data
:math:`\boldsymbol{M}` can then be decoded as
:math:`\boldsymbol{\hat{M}} = \boldsymbol{\hat{X}} \cdot
\boldsymbol{\hat{V}}^{-1}`. In practice if approximately **any**
:math:`g` symbols from a generation are received the original data in
that generation can be decoded. This is a much looser condition,
compared to when no coding is used, where exactly **all** :math:`g`
unique original symbols must be collected.

How does recoding work?
.......................
.. _recoding:

Any node that have received :math:`g'`, where :math:`g' = [2,g]` is
the number of received linearly independent symbols from a generation
and is equal to the rank of :math:`\boldsymbol{\hat{V}}`, can
recode. All received symbols are placed in the matrix
:math:`\boldsymbol{\hat{X}} = [\boldsymbol{\hat{x}_1} ;
\boldsymbol{\hat{x}_2} ; \dots ; \boldsymbol{\hat{x}_{g'}}]` and all
coding vectors in the matrix :math:`\boldsymbol{\hat{V}} =
[\boldsymbol{\hat{v}_1} ; \boldsymbol{\hat{v}_2} ; \dots ;
\boldsymbol{\hat{v}_{g'}}]`. To recode a symbol these matrices are
multiplied with a randomly generated vector :math:`\boldsymbol{w}` of
length `g'`, :math:`\boldsymbol{\tilde{v}} = \boldsymbol{\hat{G}}
\cdot \boldsymbol{w}`, :math:`\boldsymbol{\tilde{x}} =
\boldsymbol{\hat{X}} \cdot \boldsymbol{w}`. In this way we can
construct :math:`r'` randomly generated recoding vectors and
:math:`r'` recoded symbols. :math:`r'>g'` is possible, however a node
can never create more than :math:`g'` independent symbols. Note that
:math:`\boldsymbol{w}` is only used locally and that there is no need
to distinguish between coded and recoded symbols. In practice this
means that a node that have received more than one symbol can
recombine those symbols into recoded symbols, similar to the way coded
symbols are constructed at the source.


How can the role of a node change during a session?
...................................................

A sink can become a relay, and a relay can become a source. As an
example lets consider a topology with three nodes, A, B and C. B has a
link to both A and C, but A and C only have a link to B, and therefore
cannot communicate directly. A is the source and hold data that is to
be transmitted to both sinks B and C. Initially A transmits coded
packets to B. After some time B holds some coded (and uncoded) packets
but not the full data from A and starts to send recoded packets to C,
B has now become a relay. After some more time B has received enough
packets from A to decode the original data, B continues to send
packets to C, but B is now a source since it has all the original data
and can encode.

How does coding affect the overhead?
....................................

Network Coding involves some overhead as it is necessary to
communicate additional information in the coded packets (in the coding
vectors).  In practice, the size of the coding vector is generally
small compared to the packet payload. The exact size depends on the
finite field size, the generation size and the coding vector
representation.

Another source of overhead is linear dependency since a random code
might produce a small number of linearly dependent (redundant) coded
packets.  This should be considered if we choose a small field size or
low/sparse code density.

In practice, we can use a systematic code to ensure reliability with a
low overhead. This is the recommended approach in single-hop networks.


.. How does the field size affect the overhead?
.. ............................................

How does the generation size affect delay?
..........................................

The generation size :math:`g` is the number of symbols over which
encoding is performed, and defines the maximal number of symbols that
can be combined into a coded symbol. Data is decoded on a per
generation level, thus at least :math:`g` symbols must be received
before decoding is possible. Hence the size of a generation :math:`g
\cdot m` dictates the decoding delay which is the minimum amount of
data that must be received before decoding is possible.


.. How does the density impact coding?
.. ...................................

Why do we need generations?
...........................

If a whole file was considered one big block, then the computational
complexity of the encoding and decoding operations would be very
high. This is especially problematic on mobile and embedded devices
with limited computational capabilities. Therefore, large data sets
are typically split into several equal-sized generations.


When are the lost symbols/packets recovered?
............................................

Let's suppose the :math:`N` packets were lost from a generation
and the sender does not have any information about which packets were
lost. In this case, at least :math:`N` coded packets are required to
recover them. Note that the packets will not be recovered one-by-one,
but all at once after the decoder processes :math:`N` innovative coded
packets.
