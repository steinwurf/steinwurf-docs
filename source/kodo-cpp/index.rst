kodo-cpp
========

The kodo-cpp library contains high-level C++ bindings to conveniently access
the basic functionality of Kodo, such as encoding and decoding data with
various codecs.

The kodo-cpp library exposes a simple C++ Application Programming Interface
(API) which allows the programmer to use Kodo without any concern for the
underlying implementation details. kodo-cpp actually uses the C API provided by
the kodo-c library which was designed for portability and interoperability.
