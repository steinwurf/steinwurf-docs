Tutorial
========

This tutorial will demonstrate different features of Kodo and show how it can be
used to encode and decode data. Before starting this tutorial, please read the 
:ref:`including_kodo_cpp` page to learn how to compile a standalone example
that uses kodo-cpp. You are free to use the shared library or the static
library, and you can just update the code of your example as you follow
the pages of this tutorial. Note that all the code examples are based on the
latest commit in the master branch of the kodo-cpp library, so make sure that
you have the latest version when starting the tutorial.
