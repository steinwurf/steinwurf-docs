Using Kodo for Your Research
============================

One of initial reasons for building Kodo was to make a tool for doing
research on erasure correcting codes with a specific focus on network
codes. So if you have used or plan to use Kodo for your research we would
love to hear about it!

If you are doing a publication using Kodo, all we ask is that you cite our
work. Find the pdf and bibtex of the initial `Kodo paper here`_.
