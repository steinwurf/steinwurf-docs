==================
Kodo Documentation
==================

Welcome to the Kodo Network Coding library documentation.

Kodo is a C++ library for implementing Erasure Correcting Codes, in particular
Network Codes. The library is intended to be used for reliable communication
protocols and systems and for research on implementation of Network Codes.

The library enables researchers to implement new codes and algorithms,
perform simulations, and benchmark the coding operations on any platform
where a C++ compiler is available. The library provides a multitude of
building blocks and parameters that can be combined to create custom codes.
