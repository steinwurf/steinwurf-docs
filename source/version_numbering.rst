Version Numbering
-----------------
In Steinwurf we use `Semantic versioning`_ for our projects. Semantic
versioning is a very simple scheme built around the x.y.z concept
(for example 2.6.0).

.. _Semantic versioning: http://semver.org/

The basic rules we use are the following:
 * Major version: Increment x when you break backwards-compatibility (the API)
 * Minor version: Increment y when you add a new feature (without breaking
   backward-compatibility)
 * Patch: Increment z when you improve something or fix a bug (without
   breaking-compatibility or adding new functionality)
