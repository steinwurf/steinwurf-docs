:ref:`kodo`
----

Kodo is a C++ library for implementing Erasure Correcting Codes, in particular
Network Codes. The library is intended to be used as a building block for
reliable communication protocols and systems and for research on the
implementation of Network Codes.

Kodo is available under a research- and education-friendly license, and
it enables researchers to implement new codes and algorithms,
perform simulations, and benchmark the coding operations on any platform
where a modern C++ compiler is available. The library provides a multitude of
building blocks and parameters that can be combined to create custom codes.

There are several options to use Kodo in your project. Easy-to-use bindings
are available for various programming languages. The :ref:`projects_kodo`
section should help you find the best option for your needs.

:ref:`score`
-----

The Simple Coded Reliability Protocol (SCORE) provides a specialized solution
for Reliable Multicast over UDP. The protocol makes it easy to efficiently
transmit data to many devices simultaneously over a shared medium, e.g. WiFi.

Score is a commercial product, and therefore a commercial license is required
for using it. The library is available on a wide range of platforms, and
it is designed for easy integration with existing software. It exposes
a simple Application Programming Interface (API) to allow the programmer to
take advantage of Reliable Multicast in a custom application.
