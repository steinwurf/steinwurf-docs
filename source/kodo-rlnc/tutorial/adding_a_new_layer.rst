Adding a New Layer
------------------

Kodo is a set of building blocks rather than one specific code. It is
meant to be modified.

Use-cases:

* You want to change which symbols are included based on receiver
  feedback.
* You want to track the time elapsed since a specific decoder last
  received a packet.
* You want to collect statistics about the decoding
* You want to encode and decode using a sliding window
