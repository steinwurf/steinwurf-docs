======

The kodo-c library provides high-level C bindings to access the basic
functionality of Kodo, such as encoding and decoding data with various codecs.

The kodo-c library exposes a simple C Application Programming Interface (API)
which allows the programmer to use Kodo without any concern for the underlying
C++ implementation details.
