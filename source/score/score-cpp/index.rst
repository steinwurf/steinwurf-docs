score-cpp
=========

The score-cpp library provides high-level C++ bindings to access the basic
functionality of Score, such as sending and receiving data.

The score-cpp library exposes a simple C++ Application Programming Interface
(API) which allows the programmer to use Score without any concern for the
underlying implementation details. score-cpp actually uses the C API
defined in the score-c library which was designed for portability and
interoperability.
